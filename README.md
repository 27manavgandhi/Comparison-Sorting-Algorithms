# Comparison-Sorting-Algorithms
Comparison Sorting Algorithms are a class of sorting algorithms that arrange a collection of elements into a specific order based on comparisons between the elements. The fundamental operation in these algorithms is the comparison of pairs of elements to determine their relative order, and swaps or other operations are performed accordingly.
